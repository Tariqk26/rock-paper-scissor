# Getting started with live server

This project was created with a Vs code extention liveserver to host the website without any further bootstrapping necessary.

Once the extention is installed hit the `Go Live` button to host the server.

## The Process

I wanted to challenge myself and have a project to utilise some of the javascript techniques I have been learning, so I created this Rock, Paper, Scissors game using a tutorial from one of my favourite web dev youtube channels - Dev Ed. The idea was to create a short simple game where the user will be interacting with the computer to play a game. It would give me the opportunity to learn more about and implement http requests that I've been learning about like `document.querySelector` and `document.addEventListener` as well as give me an opportunity to organise my Javascript code well.

## The Challenges

I found several challenges in the making of this project, I ran into some issues to do with file paths and also file organisation which I believe led me to a 404 error message for the app.js file I've created. I'm working on debugging this soon to showcase the animations I've worked on.

I believe this was due to some issues around file structuring so I deleted the project and started again.

One other challange I ran into was where the `playerChoice` was showing as undefined, I identified that this was to do with the `compareHands`function and rewrote my compare function and conditional statement to correct the syntax error

## To Do

3. Test it and send the game to friends.
